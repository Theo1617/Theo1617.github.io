	<h3> As an important development direction in the field of modern transportation, autonomous vehicle technology has attracted extensive research and attention. This paper comprehensively analyzes the basic principles, development history, technical challenges and application prospects of autonomous vehicle technology. Through a comprehensive review and summary of relevant literature and practical cases, this article aims to provide readers with a comprehensive understanding and reference to promote the further development and application of autonomous vehicle technology.     
</h3>

     <p> As a cutting-edge technology in the transportation field, autonomous vehicles have attracted widespread attention for their development potential. The development of self-driving cars has been a journey filled with triumphs and setbacks, witnessing the rise of industry giants and fractious startups, each vying to stake their claim in the self-driving race. Breakthroughs in sensor technology, machine learning and connectivity are bringing us closer to the threshold of a driverless future. However, this also leaves us facing thorny ethical dilemmas, regulatory hurdles, and lingering safety and reliability issues.

</p>
<p>The technical foundation of autonomous vehicles covers multiple key areas, applying sensor technology, artificial intelligence (AI), data processing, communication systems and vehicle control. These technologies are the main body of self-driving cars. By comprehensively utilizing these key technologies, self-driving cars can achieve highly autonomous driving capabilities, thus bringing huge potential and opportunities to the future transportation system. However, to achieve true autonomous driving, continuous technological innovation, safety testing and various tests are still required.
</p>
<p>Currently, the development and deployment of autonomous vehicles involves multiple automakers and technology companies. Such as: Waymo, Tesla, Uber ATG, General Motors, Ford, BMW. In addition to the above brands, many other automakers and technology companies are also actively conducting research, development and testing of autonomous vehicles to promote the development of this field. With the continuous advancement of technology and the gradual maturity of the market, more car brands will launch self-driving car products in the future.
</p>

<p>Although many car brands and technology companies have made significant progress in the field of autonomous vehicles, there are still some shortcomings and challenges, such as:
Technology maturity: Most self-driving cars are currently at SAE Level 2 or 3, which still requires a human driver to intervene in certain situations.Safety: Although these vehicles are equipped with a variety of sensors and systems to sense their surrounding environment and have undergone extensive testing, there are still various potential security risks and vulnerabilities.User acceptance: Some users may be worried about safety issues, personal privacy issues, or distrust of new technologies, and thus have reservations about self-driving cars.Cost and economic feasibility: The cost of autonomous driving technology is relatively high, including costs for sensors, software, data processing, etc.If major companies can solve these problems, it will be a step forward for the development of self-driving cars.
</p>


<p> The emergence of self-driving cars has had a profound impact on society, involving traffic safety, urban planning, economic structure and people's lifestyles. The government, industry and all sectors of society need to work together, and the government needs to formulate corresponding policies and measures to cope with the challenges and opportunities brought by autonomous driving technology and promote the healthy development of autonomous vehicles.
</p>

<p>  In the future, autonomous vehicle technology will continue to develop towards higher levels and wider applications. Self-driving cars need to achieve a higher level of autonomous driving and improve safety and reliability. The government needs to coordinate the development of infrastructure and urban planning. Major companies need to strengthen user experience and acceptance. Only by improving all deficiencies can we Only then can self-driving cars be more suitable for today's society
</p>

<p>Self-driving car technology represents mankindâ€™s exploration and pursuit of future transportation methods, and its development will profoundly affect our lives and society. We look forward to witnessing the continuous innovation and evolution of autonomous driving technology in the future, creating a safer, more efficient and more convenient travel experience for humans.
